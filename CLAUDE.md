# LootFall: notes for Claude

Solo-developed PC game for Steam (Godot 4.7.2 .NET, C#, 2D, GL Compatibility renderer). The owner knows Unity/C#
and works through cloud sessions rather than locally, so changes must be verified here, not left for them to test.

## Setup in a fresh container

Run `tools/setup-cloud.sh` (add `--export-templates` before exporting). It installs the .NET 8 SDK and Godot to
`/opt/godot` and symlinks `godot`. GitHub release downloads work through the proxy; Unity's servers do not.

## Verify every change

1. `dotnet build` must report 0 warnings and 0 errors.
2. Gameplay/balance changes: `godot --headless --path . -- --sim` and compare the report before and after.
3. Visual changes: run the autoplay bot under Xvfb with `--shots=<dir>` and look at the PNGs.
   Bot flags: `--seed=N --quit-at-end --days=N --no-tutorial --start-tier=N --gold=N`. `--start-tier`
   jumps to a shop tier with the tools a player would own by then (use it to check later tiers' screens).
   Keep screenshot folders named `shots*` (git- and export-ignored).
4. Shaking or physics changes: `godot --headless --path . -- --shake-test` should hear everything the rules say is
   audible at each strength (and with the magnet), with no leaks.
5. For feel/timing, record with `--write-movie movies/lot.avi --fixed-fps 60` and convert with ffmpeg.

## Conventions

- `scripts/Core` stays engine-free (no `using Godot`) so it can be simulated headlessly.
- Design rules (see `docs/design.md`): the puzzle is three rules (a thing only sounds once the shake stirs it;
  clanks drown out delicate things; sellers price only what they think is there). Never show the player what a chest
  is worth before purchase: the slip only adds up what the player ticked, at the average for the chest's colour, and
  each item's real quality is rolled around that colour (`Categories.Odds`) so openings still surprise. Clues are
  perceptual (which sounds come at which strength, what glows, what the magnet silences, a hollow drop) or stated
  (what the seller says they heard). Any new way to judge a chest must follow a rule people know from real life.
- One sound per kind of thing, the one you'd expect in real life (`CategoryDef` in `Items.cs`); kinds differ in how
  hard you must shake to hear them (`StirsAt`) and whether they drown out or get drowned out (`Loud`, `Delicate`).
  Introduce new things one at a time: by shop tier (`CategoryDef.Tier`, `SellerDef.Tier`) and with a Bram hint
  (`Hints.cs`).
- Every seller has one way of judging a chest (`Judgment`: listening, counting rattles, weight, colour, a dream, a
  trade they know, a sense for magic, no idea) with a blind spot a careful player can see through, one way to trade,
  and maybe one thing they won't stand for, with a reward for putting up with it (`SellerDef` traits like `Patience`,
  `HatesDrop`, `HatesMagnet`, `HatesHardShake`). `Market` rolls and prices their chests; `Visit` trades, and its
  `Explain` says on the results and pass screens why a deal went the way it did. The sim's per-seller table must show
  a careful player profits from each, and buying blind shouldn't (Tam, who takes a few coins, is the exception).
- `ShakeBox` gates sounds with the same rules as `Chest.Audible`: change both together (the shake test checks them).
- UI is built in code with `UiKit` and `Painter` (absolute positions on a 1280x720 canvas), not in .tscn files.
- Buttons use `FocusMode.None`: Space is reserved for lockpicking and holding the chest open. L opens the ledger.
- `Hearing.Read` and `Strategy` model a careful player (what they hear, when they drop or use the magnet, what they
  offer and keep) for the sim and the bot. Update them when a rule, tool or trade changes.
- Phases are swapped by `Main.SwitchTo`; check `Alive` after every `await` in a phase.
- Screen effects go through `Main` (`Shake`, `Flash`, `HitStop`, `Zoom`); capture points use `Main.Moment(name)`.
- Godot C# naming differs from GDScript in places (e.g. `CpuParticles2D`, `AudioStreamWav`).

## Art direction (pixel art)

- All art comes from CC0 packs via `tools/import_art.py` (needs Pillow); edit its mappings and re-run rather than
  hand-editing `assets/`. Only GitHub is reachable from cloud sessions, so new sources must be GitHub-hosted.
  Credit sources in `CREDITS.md`.
- Keep pixels square: integer scales only (chest 12-14x, items 1-2x, backgrounds 2x, UI frames 3x), nearest
  filtering (project default), and Kenney Mini at multiples of 8px (`UiKit.MakeLabel` snaps sizes; min 16).
- Kenney Mini has no fallback font: stick to ASCII in UI strings.
- Panels and buttons use the 9-slice frames from `UiKit` (`MakePanel`, `MakeFrame`, `MakeButton`), not StyleBoxFlat.
- Item sprites vary in size (up to 72px); in 32px slots use the kind icons (`UiKit.MakeKindIcon`), drawn as 16x16
  pixel art in `tools/import_art.py` like the tool icons.

## Known gaps

- The Windows .exe has the default Godot icon (rcedit needs Wine; do it in CI instead).
- Wine 9 in this container can't run the exported .exe. `.github/workflows/windows-build.yml` exports and smoke-tests on a real Windows runner on every push; download builds from the run's artifacts.
- There's no save game yet, and sellers don't remember you (see `docs/design.md`).
