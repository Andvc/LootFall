# LootFall: notes for Claude

Solo-developed PC game for Steam (Godot 4.7.2 .NET, C#, 2D, GL Compatibility renderer). The owner knows Unity/C#
and works through cloud sessions rather than locally, so changes must be verified here, not left for them to test.

## Setup in a fresh container

Run `tools/setup-cloud.sh` (add `--export-templates` before exporting). It installs the .NET 8 SDK and Godot to
`/opt/godot` and symlinks `godot`. GitHub release downloads work through the proxy; Unity's servers do not.

## Verify every change

1. `dotnet build` must report 0 warnings and 0 errors.
2. Gameplay/balance changes: `godot --headless --path . -- --sim` and compare the report before and after.
3. Visual changes: run the autoplay bot under Xvfb with `--shots=<dir>` and look at the PNGs.
   Bot flags: `--seed=N --quit-at-end --lots=N --bot-crowbar --bot-pass-odd`. Seed 1113 is a rich demo lot.
   Keep screenshot folders named `shots*` (git- and export-ignored).
4. For feel/timing, record with `--write-movie movies/lot.avi --fixed-fps 60` and convert with ffmpeg.

## Conventions

- `scripts/Core` stays engine-free (no `using Godot`) so it can be simulated headlessly.
- UI is built in code with `UiKit` and `Painter` (absolute positions on a 1280x720 canvas), not in .tscn files.
- Buttons use `FocusMode.None`: Space is reserved for lockpicking and holding the lid.
- Phases are swapped by `Main.SwitchTo`; check `Alive` after every `await` in a phase.
- Screen effects go through `Main` (`Shake`, `Flash`, `HitStop`); capture points use `Main.Moment(name)`.
- Godot C# naming differs from GDScript in places (e.g. `CpuParticles2D`, `AudioStreamWav`).

## Known gaps

- The Windows .exe has the default Godot icon (rcedit needs Wine; do it in CI instead).
- Wine 9 in this container can't run the exported .exe, so launch-test Windows builds on a real Windows runner.
- No economy pressure yet (rent/debt), so profits only grow; balance with the sim report.
